# lua-samples

Informal public sample scripts for Lua scripting in our applications like TLex, tlTerm, tlCorpus, tlDatabase. Also main TLex and tlTerm Lua scripting reference documentation.

The Lua scripting language is integrated in many ways into TLex, tlTerm, tlDatabase and is a powerful way for advanced, technical users to extend these applications, for example, one can use Lua for smart-styling auto-punctuation rules, or to help clean up or re-model or edit or change existing data or data you're converting, or to help do advanced Lua searches using Lua filters, or to create special Lua attributes where the attribute value is generated by a Lua script.
